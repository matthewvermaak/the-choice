= The Choice

This is my first Ludum Dare entry for #LD48 (http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/).

The theme was "10 seconds".

My intention with this game was to bring the player into an isolated moment of time. Faced
with a morally gray situation, the player will be asked to make a choice. Time will slow
and the decision will require perseverance. 

Warning: This material may be objectionable to some.
